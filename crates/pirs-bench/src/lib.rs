//! pirs-bench — a benchmark-attack harness for SWE-bench-style tasks.
//!
//! The crate is deliberately small: it owns the invariant-critical primitives
//! and the verification [`gate`], while heuristics, per-ecosystem detectors, and
//! orchestration policy live in Rhai scripts layered on top. See
//! `PIRS-BENCH-PLAN.md` for the full design.
