Fix the following issue in this repository at /testbed.

Rules:
- Investigate with tools; find the true root cause before editing.
- Fix SOURCE code only. Do not edit, delete, or weaken tests.
- You may run existing project tests if helpful, but do not rely on tests that are not in the tree.
- Make the minimal correct fix; stop when you believe the issue is resolved.

## Issue
Display fixture scope with `pytest --fixtures`
It would be useful to show fixture scopes with `pytest --fixtures`; currently the only way to learn the scope of a fixture is look at the docs (when that is documented) or at the source code.
