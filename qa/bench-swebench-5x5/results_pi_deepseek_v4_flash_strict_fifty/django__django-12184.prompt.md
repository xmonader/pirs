Fix the following issue in this repository at /testbed.

Rules:
- Investigate with tools; find the true root cause before editing.
- Fix SOURCE code only. Do not edit, delete, or weaken tests.
- You may run existing project tests if helpful, but do not rely on tests that are not in the tree.
- Make the minimal correct fix; stop when you believe the issue is resolved.

## Issue
Optional URL params crash some view functions.
Description
	
My use case, running fine with Django until 2.2:
URLConf:
urlpatterns += [
	...
	re_path(r'^module/(?P<format>(html|json|xml))?/?$', views.modules, name='modules'),
]
View:
def modules(request, format='html'):
	...
	return render(...)
With Django 3.0, this is now producing an error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
